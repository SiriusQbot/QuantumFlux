Graviton:
In speculative theories of quantum gravity, the graviton is a hypothetical elementary particle 
that mediates the force of gravitation in the framework of quantum field theory.

Magnetar:
A magnetar is a type of neutron star with an extremely powerful magnetic field. 

The magnetic field decay powers the emission of high-energy electromagnetic radiation,
particularly X-rays and gamma rays.

Topological Defect:
A topological soliton or a topological defect is a solution of a system of partial differential 
equations or of a quantum field theory homotopically distinct from the vacuum solution.

A soliton is a self-reinforcing solitary wave packet that maintains its shape while it propagates 
at a constant velocity.

Magnetic Monopole:
A magnetic monopole is a hypothetical elementary particle in particle physics that is an isolated magnet with only 
one magnetic pole (ie- a north pole without a south pole).

The concept stems from particle theories, -eg- the grand unified and superstring theories,
which hypothesize their existence.

MetricTensor:
In general relativity, the metric tensor is the fundamental object of study. 

It may loosely be thought of as a generalization of the gravitational potential of Newtonian gravitation.

QuantumSymmetry:
M-theory may describe 2 and 5 dimensional objects called branes and should be approximated by 
11 dimensional supergravity at low energies. 

Attempts to formulate M-theory are typically based on matrix theory.

M-theory in physics is a theory that unifies all consistent versions of superstring theory.

Photon Sphere:
A photon sphere is a spherical region of space where gravity is strong enough 
that photons are forced to travel in orbits.

In the Schwarzschild metric, free-falling objects can be in circular 
orbits if the orbital radius is larger than 3/2 r_s  (the radius of the photon sphere)

	t[0] = t(f) * sqrt(1 - 3/2 * r_s/r) //time dilation
